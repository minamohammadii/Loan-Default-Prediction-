# LoanDefault-Prediction

# Loan Default Prediction with Explainable AI

This project focuses on predicting loan default risks using a comprehensive machine-learning pipeline. The dataset used for this project contains information on loan borrowers, and the objective is to build and evaluate models that can accurately predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The project also employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand and interpret the factors contributing to loan default risks.

This project was collaboratively developed by [Arian Mohammadi](https://github.com/arianmohammadi) and [Mina Mohammadi](https://github.com/minamohammadii). We worked together to create a machine-learning pipeline for loan default prediction and enhanced model interpretability using SHAP and LIME.

## Project Overview

Loan default prediction is a critical task for financial institutions to assess the risk associated with lending. In this project, we performed the following steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights into loan default behavior.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and performed feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
3. **Feature Selection:** Employed multiple feature selection methods, including Chi-Square, ANOVA, Mutual Information, PCA, and Feature Importance, to identify the most relevant features.
4. **Modeling:** Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models, including KNN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli), and XGBoost.
5. **Explainable AI (XAI):** Utilized SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of individual features on loan default risks.
